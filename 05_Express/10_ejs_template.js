import express from "express";
const app = express();
const port = 3000;



// Set up EJS as the view engine

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
// This line tells Express that you are using EJS as your view engine.

app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));
// 1st paramater=> "views", when res.render(...) is encountered, the express looks for file in directory named views.
// 2nd parameter=> path of the "views" directory

//npm i express-ejs-layouts
app.use(expressLayouts);
// This line specifically comes from using the express-ejs-layouts middleware.
// is used in an Express.js application when you're working with EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates and want to use layout filesâ€”kind of like a master template where you can inject content into predefined sections (like header, footer, etc.) from other views.

app.set('layout', 'mainLayout');
// Express will look for a layout file named mainLayout.ejs in the views(above mentioned) directory.

app.set("layout extractScripts", true);
// This setting tells express-ejs-layouts to extract scripts from individual views and place them into a specific section of your layout file (typically, this would be at the bottom of the page, before the </body> tag).
// 
// This means that any <script> tags defined in your views will be inserted into the layout at the location of <%- scripts %>, which is generally placed at the bottom of the body tag in the layout.

app.set("layout extractStyles", true);
// Similar to extractScripts, this setting tells express-ejs-layouts to extract CSS styles from individual views and place them into a designated section of your layout.
// 
// Any CSS stylesheets (<link> tags) declared in your individual views will be inserted into the layout where the <%- styles %> tag is placed. This is usually placed in the <head> section of your layout.
